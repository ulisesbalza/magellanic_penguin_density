### Magellanic penguin density estimation
<<<<<<< HEAD
In this work, we used the Point-Centered Quarter Method, with random systematic points every 200 m (Krebs 1998; Mitchell 2010). This method was first developed to study forest stand density and structure and it is based on the idea that density can be estimated through distances from random points to the objects of interest. It has been used to study other sessile events such as seabird nests, especially those that are not visible from the air (Priddel et al. 2006; Rush et al. 2013). For the Observatorio Island colony, variation within quarters from single points (e.g., 20-130 m) suggested a non-random distribution of nests near the sampling points. In addition, spatial autocorrelation up to 300 m of distance precluded the use of parametric estimation (Figure S1) (Fletcher and Fortin 2018). Consequently, for this, we used the non-parametric estimation described in Patil et al. (1982), which produces similar mean estimates but broader confidence intervals (Mitchell 2010). In Goffré Island, we observed nests only in tussock grasslands and prairie and negligible amounts in rushland, and we used the parametric estimation described in Pollard (1971). We based our estimates on 71 and 13 systematic points at Observatorio and Goffré Islands, respectively. For scaling up into abundance, on Observatorio Island we excluded the areas recently used by nesting imperial shags, which were not occupied by penguins, as well as the rushland area in Goffré Island for the same reason (ARR pers. obs.).
