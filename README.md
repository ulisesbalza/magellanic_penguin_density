### Magellanic penguin density estimation
In this work, we used the Point-Centered Quarter Method stratified by vegetation cover type, with systematic points each 200 m (Krebs 1998; Mitchell 2010). This method was first developed to study forest stand density and structure and it is based on the idea that density can be estimated through distances from random points to the objects of interest. It has been used to study other static items such as seabird nests, especially those that are not visible from the air (Priddel et al. 2006; Rush et al. 2013). For the Observatorio Island colony, variation within quarters from single points (e.g., 20-130 m) suggested a non-random distribution of nests near the sampling points due to locations near the border of cover types. Plus, positive spatial autocorrelation up to 300 m of distance precluded the use of parametric estimation (Figure S1) (Fletcher and Fortin 2018). Thus, in that case we used the non-parametric estimation described in Patil et al. (1982), which usually produces very similar mean estimates but broader confidence intervals (Mitchell 2010). In Goffré Island, as we observed nests only in tussock grasslands and negligible amount in rushland, we used the more commonly used parametric estimate only for that vegetation cover (Pollard 1971). 

#### Data available
In each file, each row represents a systematic point in the study area, and each column represents the distance in meters to the nearest active Magellanic nest. For details, see Mitchell (2015).
